How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It's easy to see typoes.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    If something you don't like, it's easy to roll back to previous version.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    I can control the first behavior. The latter would be useful to sudden crash.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    I think Git is more powerful than Google Docs. Git can be used in more complex
    situations.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    I can't do it right now.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    very confident.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    I want to learn how to use Github. Because numerous projects are on it.
